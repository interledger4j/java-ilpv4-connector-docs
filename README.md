## Overview

This implementation is a high-performance Interledger Connector that supports _many_ incoming and outgoing connections that are tied together by an ILPv4 packet-switching fabric.

This implementation supports the following features:

* **ILPv4:** Interledger Protocol version for as defined in [IL-RFC-27](https://github.com/interledger/rfcs/blob/master/0027-interledger-protocol-4/0027-interledger-protocol-4.md).
* **ILDCP**: Interledger Dynamic Configuration Protocol as specified in [IL-RFC-31](https://github.com/interledger/rfcs/blob/master/0031-dynamic-configuration-protocol/0031-dynamic-configuration-protocol.md).
* **ILP-over-HTTP**: Allows for sending and receiving ILPv4 packets over HTTP as defined in [IL-RFC-30](https://github.com/interledger/rfcs/pull/504).
* **Route Broadcast Protocol**: Defines how Connectors can exchange routing table updates as defined in [Route Broadcast Protocol](https://github.com/interledger/rfcs/pull/455).
* **Balance Tracking**: Durably tracks account balance updates in a high-performance manner using [Redis](https://redis.io).
* **Persistent Data Storage**: Account and other data can be stored using Postgres, MySQL, Oracle, MSSQL, and more.
